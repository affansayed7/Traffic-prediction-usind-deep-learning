# Traffic-prediction-usind-deep-learning
The aim of the project was to predict traffic using deep learning algorithms. We worked on a labelled dataset derived from Kaggle based on a highway road in US. We have used CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) with a single parameter and applied K-Fold algorithm for cross-validation.
